        <p>Time for another blog post!</p>
        <p>I've finished two more projects and actually put it up on github so I can show it off. They're the koi fish and apple projects. I showed the fish project to some of my friends, and one of them told me it gave him motion sickness. Cool. I also tried going on the page on a old phone, and it was super laggy. I honestly don't know how or why this happens. I thought it was due to the shader code being forced to run on non-applicable hardware but even with an empty scene, if I have hardware acceleration disabled, the page becomes unresponsive. Actually, me typing this made me realize that a page not being responsive means it's CPU limited, but whatever.</p>
        <p>You know what, if your device so slow it can't even run an empty scene, you don't deserve to see my code. There I said it.</p>
        <p>All jokes aside, this project really makes me want to see how far I can push the THREE.js renderer. I didn't really make this with performance in mind, although I did use mesh instancing to reduce the fish and lilypads to single draw calls. Browsing the THREE.js examples was honestly inspiring, and I thought it was so cool how it could do all that in the browser.</p>

        <h2>01/27/25</h2>
        <p>A few months have passed since the last update. I've been pretty busy with my jobs so I haven't had the energy to work on this site.</p>
        <p>For the last couple weeks, I've had the chance to work with plain HTML + tufte.css which was pretty cool. I've had to change it slightly to meet our use cases but nonetheless it was a pretty good experience. With that, I'll continue with plain HTML on this site for a bit. After all, this website will static for the time being. I will also be quitting my software job this week and my CS tutoring job soon as well. I've decided to quit due to them not aligning with what I want to do as much as I'd like.</p>
        <p>Another reason why I'm quitting is because my parents' restaurant business have been doing well. I've been helping out for some time now, but it looks like they will do okay without me. With this, I'll finally be free to accept work that requires relocation.</p>
        <p>With this newly granted free time from being jobless, I'll mainly be working on my own projects. I have many projects in mind, but I'll get to them one at a time. The first project I'll be getting to work on is my [name to be deterimined league analysis tool] analysis tool. Quite the mouthfull, I know. I've been experimenting with this project on and off for the last 8 years but I've never got it to a functional stage; I'd like to change that. In addition, I'll finally make the remaining pages for this website and publish it. That'll be it for this post.</p>

        <p>Okay. I give in. This may be the fastest fold in history but I'm switching the site front-end to React+tailwind. The page was looking good until I had to make a mobile dropdown. It looks good but if it takes 2+ hrs and 200 lines for anything remotely modern, it's just not worth my time. Plus, I have to make some dev sites at work so I might as well get some practice in.</p>
        <p>For reference, Here's the dropdown I make. I'm too proud of it to just delete it without showing it off first. (It was even animated and everything!)</p>

        <h2>08/01/24</h2>
        <p>Well, time to write the first entry! I'll take this chance to write about the development of this website. At the start, I considered using vue3+vite. I thought it would be good since front-end isn't my strong suit and because I already have some experience with Vue.js. So I made a pros and cons list.</p>
            <h3>Pros of using Vue/React</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Faster load time</li>
                <li>Faster development time</li>
                <li>Faster probably everything</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Cons of using Vue/React</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Struggle to understand what I wrote two months down the line</li>
            </ul>
        <p>Okay, I think the choice is obvious. An added perk of not using a library is that I can say I wrote this site in plain HTML and CSS. Yeah, the choice was simple.</p>
